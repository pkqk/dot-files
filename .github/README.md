# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles

## installation

1. Checkout the code repository somewhere convenient, it doesn't need to be anywhere specific.
2. run `install.sh`
  * this will symlink config files
  * by force, it doesn't back up existing files
3. Put extra config in a `bashrc.d` and add to `.gitignore` if private
4. restart your shell
  * it will be how I like it.

## useful bashisms

* `cddot` will take you to the dotfiles directory
* `$DOT` will be set to the dotfiles directory
